This portfolio website is designed to showcase my skills, experience, and contact information in a visually appealing and professional manner. The website consists of three main sections: About Me, Skills, and Contact, each accessible through a navigation bar. The About Me section serves as the landing page, featuring a welcoming message, a circular profile image placeholder, a brief introduction, and links to other sections. The Skills and Contact sections have distinct backgrounds for better visual separation. The website is built using HTML and CSS, incorporating aesthetic fonts like "Soligant" to enhance its appearance. Additionally, Bootstrap is utilized to ensure responsiveness and an elegant layout. This project follows best practices in web development while keeping the design simple yet effective.
